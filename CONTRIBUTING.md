# Contributing to niQC

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This short guide explains how to make high-quality contributions.

## Quick workflow
1. **Fork** the repository and clone your fork.
2. Create a new branch for each change:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b fix/<short-description>
   ```
3. Make small, focused commits (one logical change per commit).
4. Test or preview your change locally if relevant (see README for Docker preview).
5. Push your branch and open a Pull Request to INCF/niQC (or to PixelCraftLab/niQC if working on your fork).
6. In the PR description, explain what you changed and why; add screenshots or preview steps if helpful.
7. Respond politely and promptly to reviewer comments.

## What we accept
- Documentation fixes (typos, formatting, clarity)
- Small content additions (tools, resources) with valid links
- Minor code/design fixes to the site layout or build

## Guidelines
- Keep PRs small and focused.
- Use descriptive branch and commit names, e.g., fix/typo-getinvolved.
- Do not commit directly to master; always use a branch + PR.
- If you modify site assets (images, scripts), keep file sizes reasonable.

## Previewing changes locally
See README.md for the Docker command to run a local preview at http://localhost:9000.
